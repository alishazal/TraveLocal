## Problem
Using the local buses to travel around Abu Dhabi is a hassle. The schudules are crowded and look extremely complex. For those who travel once a month on the bus, it is hard to remember the bus numbers and routes, and putting in the effort to figure out the trip isn't worth it. 

## Project
We developed this website to facilitate the NYUAD community. We aim to provide an easier access to the local bus routes by presenting the schedule in an intuitive manner and by noitifying the user about their selected bus arrival/departures timings via email.

## Demo

The user has to fill out a form by selecting a location and time.

This is the message diplayed after submission of the form.

## Future Work

For future work, we would like to set up an auto-email sender that would send a reminder email 15 mins before the scheduled time.
